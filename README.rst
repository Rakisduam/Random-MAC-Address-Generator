MAC Address Changer
===================

Companies are tracking your identity by your MAC address when you turn on your wireless Internet on your laptop or mobile device. This experimental script randomizes the MAC address, reducing the effectiveness of that tracking method.

It has only been tested on Ubuntu 14.04. *DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DOES. IT IS NOT SUITABLE FOR GENERAL USE.*

Technology
----------

It was built in Python 3.4 but might work in Python 2.

How It Works
------------

A MAC address is commonly represented by six groups of two hex digits each.
